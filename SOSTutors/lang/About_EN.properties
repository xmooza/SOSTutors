intro=At SOSTutors we strive to match you with a tutor that will suit your specific needs and help you succeed in the areas of study that you are struggling in. Students can find tutors that fit their specific schedule and have any number of sessions with them. After a session don’t forget to rate  the tutor in order to help other students find which tutors fit their specific style of studying. SOSTutors was originally developed a group of five students from Algonquin College, who felt that no tools existed for students who were looking for tutors to help them with their classes. To counter this issue, SOSTutors was developed in 2016 and has been helping students since. The original founders include Jordan Gignac, Harry Hidayat, Aboubacar Konde, Muzammil Mirza, and Safi Naseem. We wish you luck with your studies, and don’t forget, SOSTutors is here to help you build your future.
